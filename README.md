# React Portfolio

## Description

I created my personal portfolio using JavaScript, Bootstrap and React. The website is also responsive to various device widths.

## Installation
Initialize a React application by typing `create-react-app` in the command line.

`Bootstrap` and `Fontawesome` were installed through `npm install`.

## Usage
Viewers are brought to the `About Me` section of my portfolio when the application initially loads.  Viewers can access the `Portfolio`, `Contact` and `Resume` pages by clicking on the links located in the navigation section in order to view each page.  

The `Portfolio` page contains six projects with links to both the Github repository as well as to the deployed application.  

The `Contact` page contains a form with a name, email and message fields.  Each field will show an error message if left blank.  The email field will show an error message if a viewer types an invalid email address.

The `Resume` page contains a list of my front-end and back-end proficiencies, as well as a link to a downloadable resume.

The footer section contains icon links to my <b>GitHub</b>, <b>LinkedIn</b> and <b>stack overflow</b> profiles.

## Language used
* `Javascript`

## Packages used
* `React`
* `Fontawesome`
