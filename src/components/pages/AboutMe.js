      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I grew up in California where I studied and received an associates degree in Economics.  I enjoyed working professionally as a Claims Auditor, and eventually as a Business Systems Analyst at Regence Blue Shield.  I got married and took care of my son, my pride and joy.  As my son grows more independent, I have more time to study and get back into the workforce.

        I am currently working as a Legal Assistant for a lawfirm in downtown Seattle.  Starting with a few text books, I took an interest in web development, and then resolved to attain certification. I have always been detail oriented, and I enjoy a good challenge.  I take pride in my work, and always strive to do better in everything that I do.
